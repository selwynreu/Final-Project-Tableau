# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this Data Visualization and Dashboards with Tableau project is to analyze the trend of the housing market over time and comparing the housing market in different districts and creating the proper visualizations to explain our findings.

## Process
Step 1 - Loading the data files into Tableau

Step 2 - Sorting through the data to make sense out of it and understanding what to clean and update and ensuring that the units are consistent

Step 3 - Creating the visualizations to answer all the questions

Step 4 - Finding patterns and trends from these visualizations
 
## Results
Option 1 was chosen for this project.

Housing Price Trend

The housing price is increasing at a faster rate.


Housing Price Comparison

From 2017, the housing price index shows that the housing price was getting close to the benchmark.


Housing/Office Price Comparison

The housing price and the office price indexes are pretty close, but the average office price is increasing slightly more than the average housing price.


Housing Price Heatmap

The darker red spots show the higher housing prices in Canada are in the Greater Vancouver area and Greater Toronto area.


Percent Difference between Montreal and Toronto

Overall, using Montreal as the base price, as the years go by, Toronto has been increasing at a faster rate, but in recent years, Montreal has been closing the gap between the housing prices.


Housing Price with Earnings

The housing price and earningsâ€™ trendline are very close to each other, but the housing price benchmark line is slowly increasing at a higher rate than the earnings.


Comparing Spending over Earnings in 2001 and 2014

Comparing the proportion of spending over earnings, the proportion is dropping so either the spending dropped or the earnings increased over the years.


Economic Crises

During the recession in the early 1990s, there is an initial decline, but then it increases a bit in the following year. 
During the financial crisis from 2007-2009, you can see a clear decline in the earnings, the housing prices, the office prices, etc.


Consumer Index vs. Housing Price

<img width="376" alt="Regression Model" src="https://github.com/selwynreu/Final-Project-Tableau/assets/140371106/2838c56f-a62e-4b21-a302-b6ad54b874bf">

Based on the regression model, we can predict consumer index from the housing price index as this model explains 94.95% of the data.


## Challenges 
The biggest challenge was understanding the dataset and trying to convert the JSON file onto Tableau, which we ended up using Python to extract the necessary data for the weekly earnings in order to use that file in Tableau.

## Future Goals
If I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely work on building a more visually appealing dashboard to present and working on the visualizations to better present my findings more clearly.
