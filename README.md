# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
The goal of this Data Visualization and Dashboards with Tableau project is to analyze the trend of the housing market over time and comparing the housing market in different districts and creating the proper visualizations to explain our findings.

## Process
Step 1 - Loading the data files into Tableau

Step 2 - Sorting through the data to make sense out of it and understanding what to clean and update and ensuring that the units are consistent

Step 3 - Creating the visualizations to answer all the questions

Step 4 - Finding patterns and trends from these visualizations
 
## Results
Option 1 was chosen for this project.

The housing price is increasing at a faster rate.


- Add screenshots for all visualizations in order to answer each question

## Challenges 
The biggest challenge was understanding the dataset and trying to convert the JSON file onto Tableau, which we ended up using Python to extract the necessary data for the weekly earnings in order to use that file in Tableau.

## Future Goals
If I had more time to work on this project, I would definitely work on building a more visually appealing dashboard to present and working on the visualizations to better present my findings more clearly.
